title: "Things I wish I had known about sleep"
---
I've got an almost 2 year old daughter. So, lets just say I know something about sleep. But, I'm sure there's still a few curve balls waiting for me. Looking back I shake my head in wonder at how little I knew. Here's a few things I wish I had known about sleep. 

## Sleep comes in waves
I found this incredible. You could nearly set your watch by it. The cycles are roughly 40 minutes long. They are more noticable early on because your little one will wake and need your help to fall asleep again. But, as they get older and learn to self-sooth and link cycles together you'll notice  the individual cycles less and less.

## Sleep is a learned skill
You're tired, you lay down, you close your eyes, you sleep. Right?! Apparently not.

I don't think it's quite right to say that sleep is a learned skill. At some point sleep will catch up with you. It's more a question of security and comfort. Which means the thing they actually need to learn is that even though they may not be able to see you, you're still there watching over them. 

## It's the accumulated lack of sleep that will get you
Back when I was young and foolish I'd hear friends and colleagues talk about their lack of sleep due to their little ones. I'd think to myself "Yeah, I've stayed up into the early hours of the morning before. And yeah, I felt like rubbish the next day. So, what?". Well dear reader, the thing I was so foolishly missing was that it's not just one night of poor sleep that's the problem. It's the night after night of poor sleep that will get you.
